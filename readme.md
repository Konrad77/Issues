## How to build
Open a terminal and navigate to the root  
```$ Issues>```

Then type 'make' without quotes and press enter. Wait for a few seconds.   
```$ Issues> make```


## How to use

When first launched, you'll be asked to enter your *Personal access token*. See [GitHub's help page](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/) how to create such a token.

**WARNING**: Currently this token is stored **unencrypted** on your harddisk at ```/boot/home/config/settings/IssuesSettings```.

*Issues*' main window will show a list of all your private/forked GitHub projects. Double-clicking an item will open a window of the project with a list of its currently open issues. Double-clicking an issue there will open the ticket in your browser.

## Planned features
- [x] Github repository filtering
- [ ] Filtering of issues (Open, Closed, more)
- [x] Show avatar image
- [ ] Show github icons (Public, Private and Forked)
- [x] Add custom public Repository (organization and repository name)
